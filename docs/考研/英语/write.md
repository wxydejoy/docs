### 描图

1 点题 破题
2 body
3 结论 建议 展望

(Obviously,the picture depicts a prevalent phenomenon,namely,xxx)/(Simple as it is,the picture offers much food for speculation.)

Several factors,I believe,can be easily found to analyze the phenomenon,among which I will name three extremely significant ones as fllows

First and foremost, xxx.By the same token,xxx.Last but not least,xxx.

In a nutshell,the above-mentioned can safely lead us to the conclusion that(diverse attitudes toward xxx will continue to exist)/(even more people will choose to do sth)/(xxx is to be pushed to a new high)/(countermeasures will soo be taken against the issue)/(the cultivation of xxx is of great urgency).We have good reason to expect more aconcerning the topic.

As far as I am concerened,it is high time that the authorities set up effiective regulations and organized various activities on regular basis.In the terms of individuals,attching due attention to it may be the first step towards improvement.In a nutshell,only through putting things into perspective can we embrace a brighter future.

翻译：①描图。②这幅图显然说的是主题/这幅图虽然很简单，却发人深省。③有好多因素可以分析这个现象，我从中选取最重要的三条，如下所示。④首先，论点一。⑤其次，论点二。⑥最后，论点三。第三段无建议：⑧简言之，上述讨论可以让我们得出结论，关于主题的多元观点将会继续存在/会有更多的人选择做某事/主题将会被推向新高/很快就会有应对措施/培养某种品质是当务之急。我们有理由相信，对此话题将会有更多的研究。第三段有建议：我认为，当局是时候制定规章并且定期组织活动了。就个人而言足够地重视它就是改善现状的第一步。简言之，只有正确认识它，才能拥抱美好的明天。
